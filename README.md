# Online-Shop Backend Template

This is a Backend application written by me as a template for future online store projects. Extensive customization of interrelationships of different entities using JPA / Hibernate allow to improve this system flexibly and quickly.

Implemented Spring Security. Has RBAC system that allows you to protect sensitive information. Introduced authorization system that supports 3 roles: Admin, Moderator, Customer. For additional protection - introduced mail confirmation system during registration. Tokens for mail confirmation are limited in time and become unavailable after expiration.

**Back-end:** Java Spring, MySQL, JPA
